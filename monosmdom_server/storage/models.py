# Questions that the models shall answer:
# - Give me a random URL with at least one occurrence whose domain hasn't been contacted for at least 5 minutes and isn't ignored.
# - Show me all ignored domains. (Not really supported)
# - For this domain, what are the associated URLs?
# - What are all occurrences of this specific URL?
# - Show me all disastrous URLs and their reasons.
# - Show me the domains with the most URLs.

# So we need the following concepts:
# - Domain (deduced from hostname and publicsuffixlist)
# - URL
# - Occurrence

# Stats for better intuition:
# - 422438 actual domains (22.6 chars on average)
# - maybe 400k? registrable domains after aggregating with publicsuffixlist
# - 574090 unique tag-values
# - 572470 unique URLs that should be crawled
# - maybe 500k? unique URLs that we actually want to crawl (without ignored domains)
# And that's just for Germany, at the time of writing.
